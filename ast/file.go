// Files and packages

// A File node represents a Go source file.
//
// The Comments list contains all comments in the source file in order of
// appearance, including the comments that are pointed to from other nodes
// via Doc and Comment fields.
//
// For correct printing of source code containing comments (using packages
// go/format and go/printer), special care must be taken to update comments
// when a File's syntax tree is modified: For printing, comments are interspersed
// between tokens based on their position. If syntax tree nodes are
// removed or moved, relevant comments in their vicinity must also be removed
// (from the File.Comments list) or moved accordingly (by updating their
// positions). A CommentMap may be used to facilitate some of these operations.
//
// Whether and how a comment is associated with a node depends on the
// interpretation of the syntax tree by the manipulating program: Except for Doc
// and Comment comments directly associated with nodes, the remaining comments
// are "free-floating" (see also issues #18593, #20744).
